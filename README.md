# Machine-Learning-Detection-for-Depression

Personal project
* Utilized machine learning to determine whether a person is in a state of depression.
* Built an algorithm based on a collection of 20 “sad faces” to determine depression (challenge though: what depression looks like), and its accuracy is around 50% even after adjusting the size of the images and setting the color of the images to gray.
* Article that I used for inspiration and ideas: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6749518/
* Used Python x3, OpenCV, and Windows Powershell.

Next Steps:
* Begin with detecting ‘sad’ on similar faces and then expand the data usage as accuracy improves.
* Simply use more data to help improve the accuracy.
* Use a deep learning process with tools like Tensorflow or PyTorch.
* Make a website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that can host the depression detection.
