# Machine-Learning-Detection-for-Depression

•	A personal project that I began to build a program that can use machine learning algorithms to determine whether a person is in a state of depression
•	Article that I used for inspiration and ideas: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6749518/

Goal: Build a program that can use machine learning algorithms to determine whether a person is in a state of depression 
Current state: Built an algorithm based on a collection of 20 “sad faces” to determine depression (however a challenge with what depression looks like), and its accuracy is around 50% even after adjusting the size of the images and the colour

Used Python x3, OpenCV, and Windows Powershell

Next Steps:
o	Begin with detecting ‘sad’ on similar faces and the expand the audience as accuracy improves
o	Simple use more data to help improve the accuracy
o	Use a deep learning process with tools like Tensorflow or PyTorch 
o	Make a website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) that can host the depression detection
